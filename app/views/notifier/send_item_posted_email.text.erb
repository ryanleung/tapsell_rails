Some selling tips:

(1) If you decided to cross-post to Craigslist, you’ll receive a link in your email to publish the ad and make any last-minute tweaks.  This is usually instant, but can take up to 2 hours.
(2) If you cross-posted to Free & For Sale, it should be there already!
(3) If your item doesn’t sell, try lowering the price and reposting in a couple days.

As always, we’re here if you have any questions.  Contact us or have a look at the FAQ.

Happy selling!
