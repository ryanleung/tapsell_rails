Hey <%= @user.first_name %>!

Thanks for getting Tapsell!  We’re really excited that you’re joining our friendly community of buyers and sellers.  

Some tips to get started:
- Download the iPhone app.  It has tons of features not on the site, including posting listings and messaging within the app.  Tapsell is made for mobile.
- Complete your profile with your real name and a good picture.  This helps a lot with both buying and selling.
- Post an item or make an offer for something you want!  

If you’ve got questions or feedback, contact us or look at our FAQ.  We’d be really happy to hear from you.  

Warmly,

Team Tapsell
