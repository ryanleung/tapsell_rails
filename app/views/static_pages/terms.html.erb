Tapsell's Fees Policy, which is subject to change, is incorporated into this Agreement by reference. Changes to the Fees Policy and the fees for Tapsell's services are effective after Tapsell provides you with at least fourteen (14) days' notice by posting the changes on the Service. However, Tapsell may choose to temporarily change the Fees Policy and the fees for Tapsell's services for promotional events (for example, no fee listing days); such changes are effective when Tapsell posts the temporary promotional event on the Service. Tapsell may, at Tapsell's sole discretion, change some or all of Tapsell's services at any time. In the event Tapsell introduces a new service, the fees for that service are effective at the launch of the service. Unless otherwise stated, all fees are quoted in US Dollars (USD). </p>

<p> You are responsible for paying all fees and applicable taxes associated with using Tapsell. Tapsell keeps accepted payment information on file. </p> 

<p> Fees and Termination: If Tapsell terminates a listing or your account, if you close your account, or if the payment of your Tapsell fees cannot be completed for any reason, you remain obligated to pay Tapsell for all unpaid fees plus any penalties, if applicable. If the seller's account is not paid in full and becomes past due, the seller risks penalties such as the suspension of privileges and/or termination of the account and other collection mechanisms (including retaining collection agencies and legal counsel). If you have a question or wish to dispute a charge, contact Tapsell. </p>

The buyer is obligated to deliver appropriate payment for items purchased, unless there is an exceptional circumstance. </p>

<p> Fee Avoidance: The price stated in each item listing description must be an accurate representation of the sale.

<h2 style="color:#5b4e62;"> 7. Information Control </h2>

<p> Tapsell does not control the Content provided by users that is made available on Tapsell. You may find some Content to be offensive, harmful, inaccurate, or deceptive. There are also risks of dealing with underage persons or people acting under false pretense. </p>

<h2 style="color:#5b4e62;"> 9. Item Receipt and Refunds </h2>

<p> All users share the responsibility for making sure that purchases facilitated by Tapsell are satisfactory and hassle-free. </p> 

<p> Payment: As a buyer, your credit card is charged immediately when an offer is accepted by the seller for the full offer amount. </p>

<p> Pickup: Buyers have 5 days to coordinate the pick up of the item before the seller may cancel the sale, refunding the purchase price to the original payment method. Sellers are responsible for making themselves available to buyers to pick up items, within reason, during the times they specified in the pickup availability section of the respective item listings. </p>

<p> Item acceptance: Once both parties agree that the sale is complete, the seller may request payment from Tapsell, prompting confirmation from the buyer that the item has been received and accepted, as-is. Buyers must inspect the condition of the item and ONLY accept the item if it is as described in the item listing. Once an item has been accepted, the item may not be returned to the seller and is not eligible for refund. </p>

<p> Refunds: In some cases, buyers and sellers may not be able to coordinate the pickup of an item within a reasonable amount of time or, despite a seller's positive intentions, some material information may be left out of an item's description. If an item is not as described or was not received, buyers should NOT accept the item. If an item has already been accepted, only with the seller's express consent will a refund be granted. Eligible refunds can be requested in Tapsell and will, if approved, be made by crediting the payment method used. </p>

<h2 style="color:#5b4e62;"> 10. Resolution of Disputes and Release </h2>
